# Not-Wors
### Boerewors Classification using ResNets and Transfer Learning

Inspired by the [hotdog/not-hotdog classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrk95jFVKqY) from HBOâ€™s Silicon Valley S4E4. 

# Example of Results
Fixed feature extractor trained (with transfer learning) on only ~380 images for only 2 epochs.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gianlucatruda/not-wors.git
cd not-wors
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
To run a demo, place any two pictures you like in ```/boeriebase/demo/unlabelled/``` and run:

```bash
python3 inference.py models/ffe_1013.model demo
```

To run evaluation, simply run:

```bash
python3 inference.py models/ffe_1013.model val
```
